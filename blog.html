          Low-key, reads more like an extract from a dissertation than something meant for everyone to read and explore the ideas presented.<br /><br />I enjoyed the central theme of experiencing Eros (eroticism with love? Love to the point of death? Transgression in love?) through the negative. The idea of abandoning the self in pursuit of the Other has always been attractive to me, but there is an underlying danger. For the endeavour to succeed, requires mutual self-destruction, without it, what are you left with but violence?<br />

        <h3>the writing life</h3>

          At first, I wasn't really on board with the thesis of the book. I started reading it while waiting for my sister to get her prescriptions from the optometrist at a government hospital. And, sitting there amidst all the need, the descriptions of writing as this harrowing and dangerous endeavor felt ridiculous if not insensitive.<br /><br />Now far away from the hospital, finishing it on a Sunday morning with what was probably the capstone anecdote, of the geology professor stunt pilot, David Rahm, I see the urgency. The title of the book is the writing life. And though the instrument of inspection is writing, the book is about life itself.

          It probably isn't good for you, if your heart always feels like it's about to explode.
