          The truth is I don't particularly long for the halcyon days, if there ever was,
          of the internet or computing.
          Sure, there are the memories of playing Pinball for 8 hours straight on the family computer,
          periodically interrupted by the neighborhood trouble maker inviting me for a round
          of <em>WWE</em>, or trying to woohoo in the sims 2 with my parents in the room without
          getting caught. And these memories, paltry as they are, are my treasures.
          <br>
          <br>
          What was I talking about? Ah yes, I'm bad at web design and this is my excuse
          for why my site looks like it's straight out of the rejected page for the awwwards.
          I was going to go on and on about how having the visual appetite of a Steve Jobs impersonator
          isn't damning evidence pointing to my creative rigidity, but in the odd chance that you do want to know
          about me
