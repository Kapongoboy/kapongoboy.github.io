            Why am I here? Why are you here, reading this now. I don't know but if you do, please share.

            <br>
            The truth is I don't particularly long for the halcyon days, if there ever was,
            of the internet or computing.
            Sure, there are the memories of playing Pinball for 8 hours straight on the family computer,
            periodically interrupted by the neighborhood trouble maker inviting me for a round
            of <em>WWE</em>, or trying to woohoo in the sims 2 with my parents in the room without
            getting caught. And these memories, paltry as they are, are my <em>treasures</em>.
            <br>
            <br>
            Those were my <em>good old days</em>, what I mean when I say "kids these days don't understand". It's the sims on a computer with a higher virus count, than frames per second.
            <br>
            <br>
            What was I talking about? Ah yes, I'm bad at web design and this is my excuse
            for why my site looks like it's straight out of the rejected category for the awwwards.
            I was going to go on and on about how having the visual appetite of a Steve Jobs impersonator
            isn't damning evidence pointing to my creative rigidity, but in the odd chance that you do want to know
            about me
